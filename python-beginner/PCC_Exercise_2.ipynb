      "\n",
      "Moreover, one can draw very beautiful images by looking at the *escape time* of a numerical computation:\n",
      "We will numerically determine whether a complex number $c$ belongs to the set, and if not we will keep track how many iterations are needed until $|z_n| > 2$. Plotting the escape times of a sampled grid of complex numbers as a 2D image will yield the famous *Apfelmaennchen* you might have seen before.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Write a function ``mandelbrot(relim, imlim, resteps, imsteps, maxiterations)`` that computes and returns the escape times for the mandelbrot set.\n",
      "    * ``relim`` and ``imlim`` are tuples that define the boundary of the complex plane (e.g. ``relim=(-2,1)`` and ``imlim=(-1,1)``), for convenience ``imlim`` should contain real numbers although it represents the complex axis.\n",
      "    * ``resteps`` and ``imsteps`` are integers and define the sampling resolution along each axis (e.g. 300 and 200 steps).\n",
      "    * ``maxiterations`` is an integer defining the maximum number of iterations (e.g. 50).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    * The function should sample complex numbers from the plane as defined by the parameters ``relim, imlim, resteps, imsteps`` and repeatedly apply the quadratic polynomial from above until the absolute value of a complex number is larger than 2. In case a maximum number of iterations is reached (``maxiterations``) the number is believed to be part of the set. \n",
      "    * The function should return a 2D array containing the number of iterations needed for every sampled complex number and two 1D arrays containing the sampled values along each axis. Escape times in the 2D array of exactly ``maxiterations`` indicate complex numbers that are believed to be part of the set.\n",
      "* Make a 2D color plot of the escape times, you might want to look at matplotlib's [imshow](http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/images/ref/imshow.html) function.\n",
      "    \n",
      "###Hints how the function ``mandelbrot`` may work:###\n",
      "* Create a 2D numpy array containing the escape times, in the beginning filled with zeros. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Secondly, create two 1D arrays sampling each dimension of the complex plane.  You might want to take a look at the [np.linspace](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) function. You can multiply one of the arrays with ``1j`` to create the imaginary axis. Later on you can calculate each starting complex number simply from summing individual elements of both arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The easy brute-force solution involves three nested for loops. Be aware that you can use python's ``break`` statement to leave a for loop and spare unnecessary computations.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Iterate at most ``maxiterations`` times for any value in your complex plane and apply the quadratic polynomial from above. If the absolute value gets larger than 2 you can stop iterating and store the number of iterations you have needed in the 2D escape array. Thus, for complex numbers that are actually part of the Mandelbrot set, the 2D array of escape times should contain the value ``maxiterations``.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###Hints for optimization:###\n",
      "* You can aim for an optimized version that uses vectorized computation. Here you should only need a single for loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Create a second and third 2D array containing the starting complex numbers and the intermediate values, checkout the [meshgrid](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html) function to create these.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Use the second 2D array to iteratively update all values in the third array at once (vectorized computation!). Mask all values that already escaped the boundary via boolean indexing to speed up the computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Remember that boolean indexing creates copies, not views! So you need to find a smart way to only apply the polynomial\n",
      "to values that haven't escaped without always keeping the full 2D array, otherwise internally numpy has to reiterate the full array every timestep. If you also create mesh grids of matrix indices you can reduce the 2D arrays each iteration to 1D arrays containing only the currently not escaped values. This is tricky!\n",
      "\n",
      "* Now you can use finer resolutions than above!"

However, we will keep our model simple and add a so called *reset rule*: whenever $V$ crosses a particular threshold $V(t)\\geq V_t$ then we set it back to a reset value at the next timestep $V(t+1)=V_r$.\n",
